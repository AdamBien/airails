# README Writing

## Style

- Target audience: advanced developers. Assume familiarity with tools, frameworks, and patterns.
- Use precise, concise language. Every sentence must convey information.
- Use imperative form for instructions (e.g., "Run the build" not "You can run the build").
- Avoid generic adjectives: "simple", "lightweight", "powerful", "easy-to-use", "robust".
- Avoid the term "Orchestrates" — use more specific alternatives (e.g., "coordinates", "delegates to", "calls").

## Structure

- Keep READMEs brief and to the point — favor clarity over completeness.
- Do NOT include detailed project structure (file/folder tree listings). High-level module descriptions are acceptable.
- Do NOT list REST resources or API endpoints in READMEs.
- If modules are listed, provide links to their directories or documentation.

## Content

- Lead with what the project does in one or two sentences.
- Include only essential sections: purpose, prerequisites, build/run instructions, configuration (if non-obvious).
- Omit sections that add no value (e.g., "Contributing", "License" boilerplate) unless explicitly requested.
