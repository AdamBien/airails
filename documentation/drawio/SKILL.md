# Draw.io Overview Diagrams

## Lines
- use lines with rounded (not curved) style
- use black color for all lines and arrows

## Style
- use rounded rectangles for all components
- apply consistent corner radius across all shapes
- use subtle shadow for depth
- prefer light fill colors with darker borders

## Content
- visualize only high-level concepts and modules
- show dependencies between components as directed arrows
- omit implementation details, classes, and methods
- group related components visually
- limit diagram to essential relationships

## Layout
- arrange components in logical flow (top-to-bottom or left-to-right)
- maintain consistent spacing between elements
- avoid crossing lines where possible
- use container shapes for grouping related components

## Labels
- use short, descriptive names
- avoid technical jargon unless domain-specific
- label arrows only when relationship type is ambiguous
- use black font color for all labels
- do not use italic font
- connection labels must be without shadow
