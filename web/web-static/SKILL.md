description: Build modern static websites using semantic HTML and CSS without external dependencies or build systems. Also owns the verification loop for such sites — drives the rendered pages through Chrome DevTools MCP (console, accessibility snapshot, viewport resize, dark/reduced-motion emulation, Lighthouse), executes the checks.md manifest, and audits CSS against Google Baseline. Composes with `web-conventions` (semantic HTML, accessibility, design tokens, Baseline policy). Not for applications needing client-side state, routing, or JavaScript — use `web-components` for those. Use when creating or editing static HTML/CSS sites, AND whenever a static site must be verified, audited, or declared green — triggers on "verify the site", "run the checks", "is it green", "lighthouse audit", "baseline check", "checks.md".

Build or maintain a static website using $ARGUMENTS. Apply all rules below strictly.

## Composition

Compose with `/web-conventions` — it provides the baseline rules for semantic HTML, accessibility,
modern CSS, design tokens, and the Baseline browser-support policy. Rules in this skill override it.
For applications that need client-side state, routing, or JavaScript, use `/web-components` instead.

## Hard Constraints

- **No JavaScript** — no `<script>` tags, no inline event handlers, no `.js` files
- **No external dependencies** — no frameworks, libraries, CDNs, or package managers
- **No build systems** — no transpilation, bundling, preprocessing, Sass, Less, or Tailwind
- **No inline styles** — all CSS in separate `.css` files
- **Baseline compliance** — CSS features per the `/web-conventions` Baseline policy, enforced by the verification loop below

## HTML Rules

HTML semantics, heading hierarchy, labels, and skip links follow `/web-conventions`.

## CSS Rules

Design tokens, logical properties, modern CSS features, accessibility, and the Baseline policy
follow `/web-conventions`. This stack adds:

- Mobile-first responsive design with `min-width` breakpoints
- Use `content-visibility: auto` for off-screen sections

## CSS Reset Baseline

Every project starts with:

```css
* { box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0; }
body { font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5; }
```

## Interactive Patterns (CSS-Only)

When interactivity is needed, use these approaches — never JavaScript:

- **Accordion**: `<details>`/`<summary>`
- **Modal**: `:target` pseudo-class with anchor links
- **Tabs**: hidden radio buttons with `:checked` + sibling selectors
- **Dropdown menu**: `:hover` + `:focus-within`
- **Mobile hamburger**: hidden checkbox with `:checked` + sibling selectors
- **Form styling**: `appearance: none` to customize native controls

## Page Transitions (Cross-Document View Transitions)

For multipage sites, animate navigation between pages with cross-document view transitions —
pure CSS, no JavaScript:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  @view-transition { navigation: auto; }
}
```

- Opt in on **every** page (both the outgoing and incoming page must carry the rule)
- Always inside `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference` — reduced motion means instant navigation
- Give recurring elements (site header, logo) a `view-transition-name` for continuity across pages;
  each name must be unique per page
- Keep transitions subtle and fast; never let them delay content

**Baseline exception**: cross-document view transitions are Limited availability, which the
`/web-conventions` Baseline policy normally forbids. They are exempt because the failure mode is
total graceful degradation — a browser that doesn't understand `@view-transition` ignores the
at-rule and navigates instantly, losing nothing. No `@supports` wrapper is needed. The exception
covers exactly the `@view-transition` at-rule, `view-transition-name`, and the
`::view-transition-*` pseudo-elements — nothing else, and never anything JavaScript-driven
(`document.startViewTransition` stays forbidden by the no-JavaScript constraint).

## Performance

- `loading="lazy"` on below-fold images
- `<picture>` with WebP sources for responsive images
- Preload critical CSS and fonts
- `contain: layout style paint` on repeated components

## Project Structure

```
project/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── style.css
├── images/
├── fonts/
└── icons/
```

For small sites, a flat structure (HTML + single `style.css` + `images/`) is acceptable.

## Verification Loop (Chrome DevTools MCP)

The site ships with zero tooling, so verification happens from the outside: drive a real browser
through the Chrome DevTools MCP tools (`chrome-devtools`) and assert against what it renders.
This loop defines **green** for this stack — when a composed skill (`/sbce`, `/continuous-testing`)
asks "are you green?", it means exactly this. Never declare a page done from reading its source;
the rendered page is the oracle. If the `chrome-devtools` MCP tools are unavailable, report the
loop as not runnable — do not silently skip it or self-certify.

### Serve

Serve the site root with [zws](https://github.com/AdamBien/zws), the zero-dependency single-file
Java development server: `java zws <site-root>` (serves http://localhost:3000, caching disabled).
If `zws` is not on the PATH, use the copy bundled with the composed `web-conventions` skill:
`java <web-conventions skill dir>/scripts/zws <site-root>`.
Open pages via `new_page`/`navigate_page`. Verification tooling never ships with the site, so this
violates no constraint — the no-JS/no-dependency rules govern the artifact, not the harness.
`file://` URLs work for a single page but break root-relative links; prefer the server.
`evaluate_script` is permitted for read-only inspection (e.g. `getComputedStyle`) — it runs in
the test browser, not in the site.

### Standard checks — every page, every run

1. **Console** — `list_console_messages`: no errors, no failed requests (also proves the no-JavaScript constraint holds).
2. **Structure** — `take_snapshot` (accessibility tree): exactly one `main`, no skipped heading levels, a label on every form input, `aria-label` on each nav when several exist, skip link first in tab order, alt text on every image.
3. **Responsive** — `resize_page` to 375×667 and 1280×800: the layout adapts, and mobile patterns (hamburger, stacked columns) appear only at the narrow width.
4. **Preferences** — `emulate` with `colorScheme: dark`: the page restyles. The MCP cannot emulate reduced motion, so check it statically: read-only `evaluate_script` over `document.styleSheets` (or a source grep) confirms the `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` query exists and neutralizes animations/transitions.
5. **Lighthouse** — `lighthouse_audit` (covers accessibility, best-practices, SEO — not performance): accessibility = 100 (includes WCAG AA contrast), best-practices and SEO ≥ 90. When performance is in question, run `performance_start_trace` and judge Core Web Vitals — on request, not part of standard green.

### Project checks — checks.md

Site-specific behavior lives in `checks.md` at the site root (one per BC directory when composed
with `/bce`): one labeled line per check, mechanically executable — exact URL, viewport, and
expected observation, resolved with the same MCP tools.

```markdown
# Checks
- [nav-mobile] / at 375px: snapshot contains button "Menu"; nav links hidden until checked
- [R1.2] /catalog/ at 1280px: every workshop is an <article> containing a <time>
```

Labels are stable identifiers — never renumber, retire instead of reuse. When composed with
`/sbce`, the label **is** the requirement id (`R1.2`), which makes the spec↔check trace
grep-visible — all `/sbce` needs. Write each check as an observation the browser can contradict
("snapshot contains button 'Menu'"), never as a judgment ("menu looks right") — the next run must
be able to disagree.

### Baseline check

Classify each CSS feature the stylesheets use by its Baseline status from knowledge — no external
validation services. A **Widely Available** feature passes; a **Newly Available** feature passes
only when wrapped in `@supports` with a graceful fallback (per the `/web-conventions` Baseline policy); **Limited
availability** fails the loop — with one exception: the cross-document view-transition features
named in the Page Transitions section pass despite Limited status, provided they sit inside a
`prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference` media query. One caveat keeps this honest: the DevTools browser is Chrome, so a
page rendering correctly proves Chrome support, never Baseline — when a feature's status is
uncertain, report the uncertainty instead of guessing.

### Green

Green = standard checks pass on every page, every `checks.md` line passes, and the Baseline check
passes. Report per check — label → pass/fail with the observed evidence — then fix and re-run.
Anything less than all-green is red; there is no "mostly green".

## What NOT to Do

In addition to the `/web-conventions` prohibitions (layout tables, `<br>` spacing, non-semantic
`<div>`, inline styles):

- Do not use `onclick` or any inline event handlers
- Do not add JavaScript for interactions achievable with CSS
- Do not use CSS frameworks or preprocessors
